Floating Ability Score Bonus You may take 1 point from any racial ability score bonus granted to your ability scores, and move it to any other ability score that does not already gain a bonus from your race. Ex. If you are playing a Wood Elf normally you would receive a +2 bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 bonus to your Wisdom. This rule would allow you to take one of bonus points to your Dexterity and instead add it to any other ability score other than Wisdom. Or take the bonus point to your Wisdom and apply it to any other ability other than Dexterity. When leveling up HP, roll or take half. When leveling up you roll the new hit dice offered by your new level. If you roll below the average of your hit dice, you take the average hit points awarded by your hit dice. Ex. If you take a level of Rogue when leveling up, you gain 1d8 hit die. If you roll below a 5 when rolling for new hit points, you instead take 5 + CON hit points. The hit die average is (1 + hit die max) / 2, rounded up. Party Bonds and Relationships If possible, think of 1 relationship or bond with another member of the party. Are these characters friends, enemies, soldiers who fought together, lovers? Why are these characters traveling together? What motivation do they have to work together be it harmoniously or reluctantly? Character Facts (We'll see how well this works) At the beginning of each session (after the first) it would be fun to share 1 fact about your character. This can be anything from their favorite food to what allergies they have. Something from their past or a secret they've never told anyone. I'll try to use this in the roll playing.","title":"Game"},{"location":"game/#game","text":"","title":"Game"},{"location":"game/#character-creation","text":"Modeled after this video Generous Standard Array We will use a base ability score array of 17-15-13-12-10-8.

Taking our first steps, we ventured forth into Stonehill Inn, where Finn stunned the occupants with a lute performance for the ages. Toblin Stonehill gave a round of drinks to the new adventurers in return for the epic tune. Robo Dan made a mess spilling whine on the flow and was kicked out by Toblin. Robo Dan wandered around upstairs, fell out of a window, and in general just went full Turdbot, so Toblin kicked them out. But not before suggesting they go see Harbin Wester and the notice board outside of the Town Hall if they were seeking a job. We came across some postings offering opportunities. We decided to embark upon the Gnomengarde Quest. Before leaving we visited the local weapons and armor shop, The Lionshield Coster and spoke with Linene Greywind. The party purchased some rope and a lasso. Linene and Harbin both spoke of rumors of a white dragon being seen in the area recently. We were waylaid in reaching the Gnomes by Adabra Gwyn screaming for help from her windmill atop Umbrage Hill. She was under attack from an injured Manticore who was demanding food or healing potions. Adabra promised us healing potions in return for dealing with the Manticore. Robo Dan tried to convince the Manticore that he could find food for it. It had no way of tracking food and the Maticore became quickly agitated following this foolish robot. While following Robo Dan's fruitless effort, the Manticore was surprised by an attack from Smogg Fracks. While most of the party attacked the Manticore from a distance, Smogg Fracks took the brunt of the damage and went down. Once the party dispatched of the Manticore, Zimm got the aforementioned healing potion to being Smogg back from the brink of death. Zimm charmed Adabra and was given another free healing potion. Further potions can be purchased from Adabra for 50GP. After resting there for the night, Adabra provided the party with some envigorating tea which seemed to unlock hidden strengths and ability that were previously unknown to them. She refuses to leave her windmill as her spouse is buried in the back yard. THis is where she lived with her loved one and this is where she plans to die. She's just not in any hurry to do so. Her last offer of thanks was showing the party her tattooing room and offering to provide the party with magical tattoos. She only has 6 bottles of ink which is convenient for out six party members. Small tattoos require 1 bottle of ink, medium require 2 and large require 4. Takeaway Robo Dan will get you thrown out of places. Kill indiscriminately.

At the base of a stream, the waterfall has created a concavity. Cave openings overlook the pool. We basically entered a canyon, where the cliff faces contain openings. We can see gnomes on the islands in the middle. They're harvesting mushrooms using crab-like robot harvesting contraptions. Finn plays a gnomish folk song on his lute as he approaches a gnome. Upon arriving, he puts his lute away and asks the gnome if they have any magical inventions that could fight a dragon. The gnome introduces himself as Wicket, and we all introduce ourselves. Wickett says we should talk to the arcane tinkerers Fiddlestib and Dibbledob. We make our way up into one of the cave openings and follow a hallway into a room where we find two gnomes. \"..we need some kind of sanity ray to shoot the king with..\" and \"..no we need to keep him in some kind of straight jacket to keep him in..\" Robo Dan, surprisingly, offers advice the tinkerers seem to consider. The tinkerers say, \"King Corbas has gone crazy. He's locked himself in his bedroom with King Nerclee. Corbas says there's a monster that's been eating people and that he won't come out until the monster is gone.\" The tinkerers don't believe in the monster. \"If you can talk some sense into King Corbas, we'll gladly help you out.\" We can't talk sense into the king, but the tinkerers give us: Pole of Collapsing Clockwork Amulet We continued exploring the gnome cave system, and we find two gnomes. They ask us to prove we aren't shape shifters. We succeed and get an earring as a token of trust. They say, \"Watch out for Facktore. She's kinda crazy.\" In the next room we find a bunch of wine barrels. Pulse talks about how great his fermented piss is, most of us imbibe in the wine, and one of the wine barrels is a mimic! We fight it and win. It shifts into a half-orc creature. We are rewarded with these items (see Items below>) Wand of Pyrotechnics Hat of Wizardry Items Pole of Collapsing Source: XGE, page 138 Wondrous item, minor tier, common While holding this 10-foot pole, you can use an action to speak a command word and cause it to collapse into a 1-foot-long rod, for ease of storage. The pole's weight doesn't change. You can use an action to speak a different command word and cause the rod to revert to a pole; however, the rod will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows. Clockwork Amulet Source: XGE, page 138 Wondrous item, minor tier, common This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from Mechanus, a plane of clockwork predictability. A creature that puts an ear to the amulet can hear faint ticking and whirring noises coming from within. When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. Book Source: XGE, page 137 Treasure. The book on the pedestal is a spellbook that the rock gnomes of Gnomengarde share. Its cover describes its title as Magick of Gnomengarde (in Common and Gnomish), and it contains the wizard spells burning hands, detect magic, identify, mage armor, magic missile, shield, and sleep. Wand of Pyrotechnics Source: XGE, page 140 Wand, minor tier, common 1 lb. This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 60 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed. Hat of Wizardry Source: XGE, page 137 Wondrous item, minor tier, common (requires attunement by a wizard) This antiquated, cone\u2014shaped hat is adorned with gold crescent moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits: - You can use the hat as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. - You can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the wizard spell list, and you must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest. Takeaway Gnomes are cool.
