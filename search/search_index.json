Upon arriving, he puts his lute away and asks the gnome if they have any magical inventions that could fight a dragon. The gnome introduces himself as Wicket, and we all introduce ourselves. Wickett says we should talk to the arcane tinkerers Fiddlestib and Dibbledob. We make our way up into one of the cave openings and follow a hallway into a room where we find two gnomes. \"..we need some kind of sanity ray to shoot the king with..\" and \"..no we need to keep him in some kind of straight jacket to keep him in..\" Robo Dan, surprisingly, offers advice the tinkerers seem to consider. The tinkerers say, \"King Corbas has gone crazy. He's locked himself in his bedroom with King Nerclee.

The book on the pedestal is a spellbook that the rock gnomes of Gnomengarde share.

We can't talk sense into the king, but the tinkerers give us: Pole of Collapsing Clockwork Amulet We continued exploring the gnome cave system, and we find two gnomes. They ask us to prove we aren't shape shifters. We succeed and get an earring as a token of trust. They say, \"Watch out for Facktore.

We are rewarded with these items (see Items below) Wand of Pyrotechnics Hat of Wizardry Items Pole of Collapsing Source: XGE, page 138 Wondrous item, minor tier, common While holding this 10-foot pole, you can use an action to speak a command word and cause it to collapse into a 1-foot-long rod, for ease of storage. The pole's weight doesn't change. You can use an action to speak a different command word and cause the rod to revert to a pole; however, the rod will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows. Clockwork Amulet Source: XGE, page 138 Wondrous item, minor tier, common This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from Mechanus, a plane of clockwork predictability. A creature that puts an ear to the amulet can hear faint ticking and whirring noises coming from within. When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. Wand of Pyrotechnics Source: XGE, page 140 Wand, minor tier, common 1 lb. This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 60 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed. Hat of Wizardry Source: XGE, page 137 Wondrous item, minor tier, common (requires attunement by a wizard) This antiquated, cone\u2014shaped hat is adorned with gold crescent moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits: - You can use the hat as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. - You can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the wizard spell list, and you must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest. Takeaway Gnomes are cool.

An armor-clad half-orc named Moesko sitting on a chair on the north wall began pummeling Pulse with lightning. Unconsciousness ensued. Everyone else rushed in. Moesko rushed up the spiral staircase with Pulse in his arms. Suddenly, there were slashes, flurries of blows, bludgeoning, and hideous laughter...Moesko drops Pulse and goes prone as he falls into fits of laughter. The group proceeds to finish him . We climbed the staircase and strike through the heart. Finally, we're pretty sure this absolutely kills Moesko at last. He was an Acolyte of Talos. He would crash ships on the shore. So it's good he's dead. Wyatt started a serious heart to heart conversation with Robo Dan, but Robo was in complete denial about not being human. In all likelihood, Robo's creator simulated this biological defense mechanism to unconsciously protect Robo Dan from anxiety arising from unacceptable thoughts or feelings. It may have been easier to simply program Robo to be comfortable with his mechanical nature, but instead, Robo was designed as a self-loathing, mechanophobic bigot who is incapable of rationalizing the core fact of his existence. He simultaneously exhibits self pity and a grandiose vision of himself, likely in a futile attempt to escape the twisted, cruel, and ultimately programmatic and paradoxical prison in which his central processing system is forced to reside. Robo Dan will not age, so death is not inevitable. He will continue to torture himself and others by way of his very presence until he suffers an accident or is the recipient of violence. Even then, the accident or act of violence must be so utterly complete as to cause irreparable damage to his body. As it is likely that the ruthless algorithms that self-anthropomorphize Robo Dan also simulate the pain delivered by the central nervous system of a living creature, the penultimate accident or violent act will almost certainly be excruciating. As such, Robo Dan will die as he lived, an unrelenting and unnatural monument of tormented depravity, forever a stain on the existence we call reality, and perhaps the not-quite-living embodiment of hell itself.

Afterwards, we followed the trail up to the lighthouse. Pulse explored the harpy nests and found a Potion of Water Breathing. An armor-clad half-orc named Moesko sitting on a chair on the north wall began pummeling Pulse with lightning. Unconsciousness ensued. Everyone else rushed in. Moesko rushed up the spiral staircase with Pulse in his arms. Suddenly, there were slashes, flurries of blows, bludgeoning, and hideous laughter...Moesko drops Pulse and goes prone as he falls into fits of laughter. The group proceeds to finish him . We climbed the staircase and strike through the heart. Finally, we're pretty sure this absolutely kills Moesko at last. He was an Acolyte of Talos. He would crash ships on the shore.
