# How to use this repo for your own DnD campaign

Built using the amazing [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)

## Recommended tools

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for editing files
- Bash shell ([WSL2 if Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10))

## Clone the repo

```git clone https://github.com/willquill/dnd-icespire.git```

## Modify files

Modify mkdocs.yml to reflect your own site_name, pages, and theme.

## Build

```mkdocs build```

## Test

```mkdocs serve```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to see it in action.

Wanna know what's _really_ cool? You can edit your files on the fly and see the effect while ```mkdocs serve``` is active.

## Deploy

### Put your Github private SSH key into ~/.ssh

For example, I'm using id_rsa_willquill

```chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_willquill```

### Create ~/.ssh/config file and put in these contents but customized for you

```Host github-as-willquill
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_willquill
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

### Create your own repo on Github

Go to github and create a public repository.

### Add new public repo

Add the remote repo using the Host name from the config file above and use youruser/yourrepo.git

```git remote add origin git@github-as-willquill:willquill/dnd-icespire.git```

### If you've enabled e-mail privacy in Github

1. Go to the Github Emails page [here](https://github.com/settings/emails)

2. Copy the Github-provided email on that page and paste the following into your terminal:

```git config user.email theid+youruser@users.noreply.github.com```

### Push to your master branch for good measure

```git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```

### Deploy

```mkdocs gh-deploy```
