# 005 - Crab

## What Happened

Ventured in the direction of a lighthouse. Met a talking crab named Crabby.

We walked across a bridge, meeting Meerel on the way. She used to watch over the lighthouse, but there's an evil wizard atop it named Monsanto, who killed her and took her spellcasting focus (an opalescent shell).

We continued a short distance further and encountered three harpies who immediately charmed Wyatt, Robo Dan, and Crabby.

Finn cast [Silence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence) to encompass all three harpies, immediately nullifying the charm.

We continued to collectively *demolish* the harpies.

## Takeaway

Don't fuck with Crabby.
