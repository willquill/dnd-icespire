## The Manticore

### What Happened

Our merry band of adventurers mysteriously materialized themselves in front of Phandalin's Shrine of Luck. Taking our first steps, we ventured forth into Stonehill Inn, where Finn stunned the occupants with a lute performance for the ages. Turdbot wandered around upstairs, fell out of a window, and in general just went full Turdbot. So we got kicked out.

We came across some postings offering opportunities. Deciding to embark upon the Gnomengarde Quest, we proceeded to mercilessly slaughter a Manticore. In return, we were gifted six ounces of ink by NAMEHERE.

### Takeaway

Don't trust Turdbot. Kill indiscriminately.
